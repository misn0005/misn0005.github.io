                My name is <em>Dante Misner</em>, and I am currently enrolled in the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> course at Algonquin College. With full-time studies, and part-time employment taking up the majority of my week, it doesn't leave me lots of free time. Pile on top the seemingly never-ending cycle of lockdowns and restrictions, finding something engaging during that free time can be a task of itself.

                One of my favourite things to do during the summertime, is spend the day with my friends. Often times we go outside with no real place or objective in mind, walking/biking around the city, and exploring new and hidden sections of the Ottawa-Gatineau area we've never been to before. We often take photos of our adventures to look back and remember all the places we've visited together.
